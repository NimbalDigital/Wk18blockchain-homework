# Algorand: Blockchain Case Study 

## Introduction
Algorand is a permissionless, open-source decentralized blockchain network built to solve the blockchain trilemma of achieving speed, security and decentralization simultaneously.  

Algorand officially launched in June 2019 and was founded by computer scientist Silvio Micali. There is a hard supply cap of 10 billion ALGO coins.


## What is it?

Algorand is a payments-focussed netwok which seeks to combine features of mainstream, well-established cryptocurrencies–such as decentralization, transactions without a central authority, easy-to-divide tokens–but with added speed and less computing power necessary to run the system.

Algorand uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, and distributes validator rewards to all holders of its native ALGO cryptocurrency. 

The Algorand Foundation, the non-profit organization overseeing and funding development of the protocol, says that only 10 billion units of its ALGO cryptocurrency will ever be created.

Algorand maintains a block explorer, which keeps an official count of its circulating supply. 


## What sets it apart? 

Most notable is that Algorand distributes the ALGO cryptocurrency it introduces into its economy with each new block to everyone who holds a certain amount of the currency in its wallets.

Algorand uses a unique variation of Proof of Stake called Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS). PPoS is a highly democratized PoS consensus mechanism with a low minimum staking requirement for participating in and securing the network — only 1 ALGO coin is required to participate. By contrast: Ethereum 2.0 requires a minimum stake of 32 ether (ETH), an amount which establishes a much higher barrier to entry for users.

## Why this matters?

Algorand has been cited as a token that may challenge Ethereum’s status as one of the biggest and most significant altcoin. Here are some differences.

Rising fees on Ethereum had led DeFi developers to look to Algorand to develop applications. Transaction fees on Algorand tend to be lower than on the Ethereum network.

While Algo is still in a somewhat nascent period, the benefits include a brand-name and esteemed development team led by a world-leading cryptographer. Some claim that Algorand is faster and more efficient than alternatives. For instance, the transaction speed of Algorand is about 5 seconds. Meanwhile, Litecoin’s transaction speed is 2.5 minutes, while Bitcoin’s has hovered around 9 minutes.


Another key consideration for the future value of Algorand is it's commitments to sustainability and environmental impacts. Algorand was built as a green blockchain with an environmental impact focus from the very beginning. With its unique consensus mechanism, Algorand is far more energy efficient than other blockchains, and is going further by offsetting its small carbon footprint in partnership with ClimateTrade.
